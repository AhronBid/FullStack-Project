 * Data Storage - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * This file is no longer used. The application now uses MongoDB with Mongoose.
 * All data is stored in MongoDB collections:
 * - Users: stored in 'users' collection via User model
 * - Properties: stored in 'properties' collection via Property model
 * 
 * See:
 * - models/User.js for User schema
 * - models/Property.js for Property schema
 * - config/database.js for MongoDB connection
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference but can be safely deleted.
